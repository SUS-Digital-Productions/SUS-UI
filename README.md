# SUS-UI

**SUS-UI** is a powerful yet lightweight **React-based UI template** designed specifically for developers building applications on the **WAX blockchain**. It provides everything you need to rapidly bootstrap a frontend with blockchain functionality, including wallet login, network configuration, and NFT integration — all powered by the modern **WharfKit** stack.

Whether you're creating a staking portal, NFT marketplace, or token-based game dashboard, SUS-UI helps you skip the repetitive setup and jump straight into development.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **WharfKit Integration**  
  Includes built-in support for [WharfKit](https://github.com/wharfkit), enabling seamless wallet authentication using WAX-compatible wallets.

- ✅ **Dynamic RPC & API Switching**  
  Uses React Context to allow runtime switching of:

  - **WAX RPC endpoints** for blockchain interaction
  - **AtomicAssets API endpoints** for NFT and asset data

- ✅ **Clean, Extensible Architecture**  
  Easily modify or extend components for your specific use case.

- ✅ **Developer-Focused Template**  
  Simple structure, minimal dependencies, and modular design patterns help developers stay productive and focused.
